<div>
  This code snippet will let us to track our favourite product's price from Amazon. <br/>
  The first process is that we provide the URL of your favourite product, later which we will scrap the website
  for identifying the exact tags that renders the price information.
</div>

<div style={{color: "red"}}>This will not work for Gmail accounts as it has stopped access to less secured apps.</div>

### Firstly we need to import few libraries.
<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
  {`
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import smtplib
    import time
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

<p><strong>BeautifulSoup</strong> is a python library that is used for parsing the HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree of the whole page that is further used to extract data from desired tags.</p>

<p><strong>requests</strong> is a library used for sending HTTPS requests that returns a Response Object with all the data including status, content, encoding, etc.</p>

<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
  {`
    URL = ' {URL of your Product} '
    headers = {"User-Agent": 'headers of your browser'}
    """
 function that parses the product page for product name and price 
 and checks the price 
""" 
def check_price():
    page = requests.get(URL, headers=headers)

    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')

    title = soup.find(id="productTitle").get_text()
    price = soup.find(id="priceblock_ourprice").get_text()
    converted_price = float(price[1:5])

    if (converted_price < " {actual price of product} "):
        send_mail()

    print("Product: ", title.strip())
    print("Product's Price: ", converted_price)


"""
 function that sends email when product price decreases using SMTP protocol
"""
def send_mail():
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.ehlo()
    server.starttls()
    server.ehlo()

    server.login('{your email ID} ', ' {App Password} ')

    subject = "Price Decreased on your Favourite Product on Amazon !!"

    body = 'Check this Amazon link {URL} '

    msg = f"Subject: {subject}\n\n{body}"

    server.sendmail(
        ' {From Email} ',
        ' {To Email}',
        msg
    )

    print("Email Sent Successfull!")

    server.quit()

while (True):
    check_price()
    time.sleep(60*60)
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

<p>In the above snippet, there are two functions - ```check_price()``` and ```send_mail()```</p>

<p><strong>```check_price()```</strong> sends a requests with given URL and required browser headers. After a 200 OK Response, BeautifulSoup parses the html page for the content and stores whole parsed document in a variable.</p>
<p>After storing the parsed html content in a variable, we find the ids of the title and price by using get_text() method that returns the text inside the tag with "productTitle" and "priceblock_ourprice"</p>
